# Adobe-XD-to-Flutter-Projects
This repository contains the flutter codes, apk files and corresponding Adobe XD files that have been copied into Flutter dart code.
My goal when I created this repository is to show people (hopefully possible hiring companies) that I can create flutter apps given a design (preferrablly in Adobe XD format). I tried writting description for all of the applications.
## Uvento App
### This one is a two paged app UI that contains a landing page and one homepage. It's design resembles an application which provides nearby events.
## Podcast App
### This one is a 24 pages long app that resembles almost all of the required pages for a fully fleged podcast application.
